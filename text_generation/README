this directory includes all programs for the generation of text.
the attempt is to accurately generate/predict 2019 christmas speech.
the most successful of the attempt is the pretrained code. 
This comprises the data_style folder, with texts for style inside;
the pretrained_add_style python file, which trains the pretrained model on custom data-style;
the generate_text_main python file, which provides the seed, and generates text. 
helper functions required for this code to work are provided by Gero et al. https://github.com/kgero/style-gen
(downloading of pre-trained model is also required.)
